# ICSP_Pentagol
This is my first serious project in Introduction to Computer Systems and Programming course at university under supervision of [Dr. Manouchehr Moradisabzevar](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~moradih). It's a game like Pentago but with a different rule. You must creat L pattern instead of I pattern to win. Check out [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/pentago/game-rules.php) to have more information about Pentago.
# What is Pentagol
Actually Pentagol is not a general game and it has defined just for this project. So, it has own rules and own gameplay.
# Pentagol Gameplay
There is a 4 twistable 3x3 game blocks in Pentagol. The goal is to put four consecutive marbles and one next to the last one of them (Like L) in the middle row of two adjacent quadrants (three in the middle row of one quadrant, two in the middle row of another quadrant) and then line them up. n the beginning of the game, there will be neutral game blocks, allowing a player to ignore the twist portion of their turn. A neutral game block is one that is empty or has only one marble in the middle of it.
In this picture you can see a real plate of the game.

# Parts of project
In [CA & Report](https://github.com/mahdimoeini8102/ICSP_Pentagol/tree/main/CA%20%26%20Report) folder you can see the descreption of project and a flowchart that I've drawn it. This project must implemented in two ways. One in terminal environment and one in a graphical environment. So, There are two folder In [Codes](https://github.com/mahdimoeini8102/ICSP_Pentagol/tree/main/Codes) folder. One for the graphical environment and one for the terminal environment.
Also, there is a "BGI2010" zipped file that developed by teacher assistants of the course and we used it to have a graphical environment using C. You can download and use.
# How to run
Just go to [Executable Files](https://github.com/mahdimoeini8102/ICSP_Pentagol/tree/main/Executable%20Files) and download two .exe files. One is the game in terminal environment and another is the game in a graphical environment. You can see these two pictures from them:
