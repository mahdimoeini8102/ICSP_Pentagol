# ICSP_Pentagol
This is my first serious project in Introduction to Computer Systems and Programming course at university under supervision of [Dr. Manouchehr Moradisabzevar](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~moradih). It's a game like Pentago but with a different rule. You must creat L pattern instead of I pattern to win. Check out [here](https://www.ultraboardgames.com/pentago/game-rules.php) to have more information about Pentago.
# What is Pentagol
Actually Pentagol is not a general game and it has defined just for this project. So, it has own rules and own gameplay.
# Pentagol Gameplay
There is a 4 twistable 3x3 game blocks in Pentagol. The goal is to put four consecutive marbles and one next to the last one of them (Like L) in the middle row of two adjacent quadrants (three in the middle row of one quadrant, two in the middle row of another quadrant) and then line them up. n the beginning of the game, there will be neutral game blocks, allowing a player to ignore the twist portion of their turn. A neutral game block is one that is empty or has only one marble in the middle of it.
In this picture you can see a real plate of the game.

To run Pentagol in graphical environment you must use "bgi" that developed by teacher asisstants of the course.
